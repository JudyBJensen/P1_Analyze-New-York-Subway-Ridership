When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you are working with other who may also contribute to the file, or may
  want to work on the file from a different computer
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  A fork creates a copy of a repository on GitHub to GitHub that reflects the original author / file.  
  A clone is a copy of a   GitHub repository that is created on a local host.  Branches are also a copy of
  a repository that maintain rev control by allowing users to create a copy of a file and make 
  modifications without changing the master branch.
